Employees Database (MySQL Workbench)

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a relational database system for managing employee and HR data using MySQL Workbench. It simulates a real-world corporate HR structure with departments, job titles, salaries, and employee assignments.

🎯 Objectives

Design a normalized relational database schema.
Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Execute SQL queries to retrieve and analyze employee and department data.
Understand relationships between entities such as employees, managers, and departments.

🧱 Database Structure

Tables Created:

employees – employee details and job titles
departments – department info
titles – job role types
dept_emp – employee-department relationship
dept_manager – department management assignments
salaries – employee compensation data

💡 Key Queries Executed

Retrieve employee details with their salaries.
List managers and their departments.
Find employees by department (e.g., Finance, Engineering).
Analyze employee hiring trends and name frequencies.
Join multiple tables to produce meaningful HR insights.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

MySQL Workbench for database design and SQL scripting.
SQL (DDL & DML) for table creation, joins, and data manipulation.
ER modeling and relational database normalization principles.

🚀 Outcome

The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL querying, database design, and data relationships, forming the foundation for data analytics and BI dashboards (e.g., integrating with Tableau or Power BI).
